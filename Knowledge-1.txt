1.  Shell file doesn't necessarily need to have .sh as file extension, but having it will make editor easy to parse the file format.

2.  Usually, the 1st line of your bash script is 
    #! /bin/bash
    It denotes where is you bash, and tell file interpreter what shell you are using. 
    You can know this by running 'which bash'command.
