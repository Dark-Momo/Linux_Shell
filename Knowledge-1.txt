1.  Shell file doesn't necessarily need to have .sh as file extension, but having it will make editor easy to parse the file format.

2.  Usually, the 1st line of your bash script is 
    #! /bin/bash
    It denotes where is you bash, and tell file interpreter what shell you are using. 
    You can know this by running 'which bash'command.

3.  In Shell, there are 2 types of variables: system variables and user defined variables.
    - System Variables
    Created and maintained by Linux operating systems. Their names usually are in capital letters (Convention, not rule).
    - User Defined vVariables
    Created and maintained by users. Their names usually are in lower letters (Convention, not rule).

4. Assignment in Shell doesn't accept space.
   name=Mark    # name is "Mark"
   name = Mark  # name is ""

5. read without variable name : Default $REPLY will hold user input;
   read with variable name;
   read -p : Input at current line; 
   read -sp: Silently input at current line, such as for password input;
   read -a : Input in array form;

6. echo itself will output a new line '/n';
